# HCL Domino License Analysis Utility

This utility will assist HCL Domino Administrators in determining your Authorized User Count within their HCL Domino environment according to the CCB & CCX license model.

## Purpose
The purpose of this utility is to provide fast and accurate Authorized User counts for HCL Domino environments by aggregating information that a Domino Administrator would otherwise have to collect manually.

The DLAU automates the process by aggregating all the information that is needed to accurately determine the Authorized User counts in a fraction of the time.
