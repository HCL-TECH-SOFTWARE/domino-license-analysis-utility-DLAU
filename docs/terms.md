## Versioning

The HCL Domino License Analysis Utility will adhere to the following versioning guidelines as much as possible. Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

* A release may update the design, look-and-feel, or branding of an existing version
* We will not intentionally release a `patch` version update that breaks previous functionality
* A `minor` or `patch` release will never remove functionality
* Bug fixes will be addressed as `patch` releases unless they change existing functionality, then they will be `minor` releases
